Data and label preprocessing:
1. annotation_2.ipynb
2. annotation_3.ipynb

Model Example:
1. The Swin-transformer model is  at "dpcv/modeling/networks/swin_transformer.py"
2. The trainer is at  "dpcv/engine/bi_modal_trainer.py"
3. The runner is at "dpcv/experiment/exp_runner.py"
4. The config file is at "config/unified_frame_images/MOSE_10_swin_transformer_Alia_test2.yaml"
5. The bash file "MOSE_run_exp_tryGPU_ST_test.sh"
6. The datasets are too large to upload. (Please contact us)
7. The results are too large to upload. we can see sample output. "slurm-9539377.out"
